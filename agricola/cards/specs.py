"""Occupation card specifications: the on-play effect callbacks the engine
dispatches when an occupation is played from hand.

Occupations carry no structured cost / prerequisite in the card data (their JSON
entries are just name / category / text — see CARD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md II.4),
so each occupation's effect is hand-written as a card module under
`agricola/cards/` that calls `register_occupation`. The registry is populated at
import of the `agricola.cards` package (engine.py imports it at load), mirroring
the trigger / harvest-conversion registries.

The play COST is route-dependent (Lessons charges `occupation_cost`; later Scholar
charges 1 food), so it lives on the play pending, not here — a spec is purely the
card's effect. The parallel `MINORS` registry (structured cost / prereq / passing)
lands with the minor-play path.
