"""Card package.

Importing this package imports each card module so their register() calls
run at module load time, populating agricola.cards.triggers.TRIGGERS and
agricola.cards.triggers.CARDS, as well as predicate-extension registries
in agricola.legality (e.g., BAKE_BREAD_ELIGIBILITY_EXTENSIONS).

The harvest_conversions module is imported here too so the three built-in
craft conversions (joinery / pottery / basketmaker) register their entries
in HARVEST_CONVERSIONS at package load — paralleling the trigger registry
pattern.

Future card modules are added to this file as they're implemented.
