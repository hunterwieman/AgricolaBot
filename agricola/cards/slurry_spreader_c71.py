"""Slurry Spreader (minor improvement, C71; Corbarius Expansion; Crop Provider).

Card text (verbatim): "In the breeding phase of each harvest, if you get newborn
animals of at least two types, you also get a "Sow" action."
Clarification (printed): "You must be able to accommodate each newborn in order
to get it."
No cost, no prerequisite, no printed VPs.

**card_id `slurry_spreader_c71`, not the name slug** — the Artifex A106
occupation of the same name (an unrelated last-crop-from-a-field income card,
implemented first) already owns the `slurry_spreader` slug; the web UI's
card-metadata join carries an explicit (slug, deck) alias for this id (the
Market Stall C54 precedent).

TIMING — the breed frame's post-commit stretch (user ruling 20, 2026-07-05:
an outcome-reactive breeding grant surfaces AFTER CommitBreed, before Stop,
still inside the breeding phase — the ``PendingHarvestBreed`` frame's
"breeding_outcome" trigger event). Two seams carry it:

- ``register_breeding_outcome_auto``: at CommitBreed the engine hands every
  registered consumer the ``BreedingOutcome`` payload — which newborns were
  actually PLACED (0/1 per type). Eligibility is the printed condition,
  ``outcome.types >= 2``; the apply latches the qualification ROUND-KEYED in
  this card's card_state (harvest rounds are unique, so a stale latch from an
  earlier harvest is inert with no clearing step). The printed clarification
  is inherent in the payload: a newborn the player cannot accommodate is
  never placed, so it never appears in the outcome.
- ``register("breeding_outcome", …)``: the optional FireTrigger offered on
  the still-open breed frame after the commit. Eligibility = this round's
  latch AND a sow being committable right now (>= 1 empty field cell AND
  grain or veg in supply) — a pushed ``PendingSow`` with no legal commit
  would be a dead frame, so the trigger is withheld instead
  (CARD_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md §2). Firing pushes an UNCAPPED ``PendingSow`` —
  "a 'Sow' action" is the full standard sow (any number of empty fields,
  grain and/or veg), unlike Fodder Planter's per-newborn ``max_fields`` cap.
  Once per harvest comes from the breed frame's ``triggers_resolved``.

OPTIONALITY — "you also get a 'Sow' action" grants a sub-action, and a granted
sub-action must have a decline path (CARD_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md — granted
sub-actions are optional): declining is Stop on the breed frame without firing
the trigger. Once fired, the sow commits like any standard sow (at least one
field; eligibility guarantees a commit exists).

Card-only registries, all ownership-gated at the enumerator/auto dispatch: no
Family game ever owns the card, so the Family game is byte-identical and the
C++ differential gates are untouched.
